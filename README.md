3D Printer Dry Box System

## Overview

This is mostly a collection of prints and ideas I found while researching what I wanted in a dry box system, combined with a few things I've created, and the things I've learned. It's taken me months to identify, test, and streamline the process for my purposes, and I figured I would try to save others some time.

Here were my goals for the system:

* Single-spool storage: I want to be able to move spools around as space dictates without exposing them to the elements. Specifically, I don't want to have to keep all my filament next to my printer--just the spools in use.
* Reverse-Bowden: I want to keep the filament enclosed all the way to the print head as well as be ready for the MMU upgrade when I get it. This wasn't a big factor at first but ended up being one of my favorite aspects. The Reverse Bowden prevents spool tangling and snagging even with retractions.
* Visible Desiccant Storage: I don't necessarily print often, and I tend to collect filament, so my spools hang around for years sometimes. I need to actively keep them dry--not just airtight--and also know when the desiccant is getting used up.
* Stackable and Easily Stored: self-explanatory given my small storage area.
* Multiple Spool Sizes: I have quite a few 750g spools, as well as a multitude of samples that I want to protect as well.

It started with an exhaustive search which led me to BazzelRoller's [Universal 21-Cup Dry Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm00wsTj0Ho) system on YouTube. I liked it a lot, but I don't really have room to keep PVC lengths in my apartment and I wanted the ability to use dessicant to keep my filament dry over long periods. I tried printing PVC replacements, but ended up just finding the [Ultimate Spool Roller v2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3341611) by Trugdolite. This was the key design that I built the system around.

For each dry box, you need the following:

* 1x Rubbermaid 21-Cup storage bin
* 1x print [Ultimate Spool Roller v2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3341611)
* 4x [608 bearings](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R7PR72H/) (low quality work fine)
* 4x M3x6 socket-head cap screws
* 1m [4mm PTFE tubing](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MPSBS2B/) (or the length of your choice)
* 1x [M10-PC4 pneumatic fitting](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IB81IHG/)
* 1/2 cup [desiccant beads.](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01I5Y2DG6/)
* [Silicone sealant](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M2UPAG/)
* Assorted drill bits (brad-point work amazingly for plastic)

Optional:

* [M10-PC4 pass-thru flange](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/39716): makes mounting the pneumatic fitting easier
* Panel-mount hygrometer: detailed humidity info
* M10 jam nut and M10 fender washer: useful if your fitting hole doesn't turn out well
* Plastic cutting tool for hygrometer (an oscillating tool with cutting blade works excellent)
* The cutting template in this print
